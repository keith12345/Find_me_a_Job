# Job Hunting using Natural Language Processing

### The Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from many discussions with the other fellows at Metis in which we agreed that the titles given in data-related fields can be quite ambiguous. Some companies may define a particular role as a data scientist while others see it as a machine learning engineer. Others still may feel that the role is within the product science team. 

### The Objective
My goal in approaching this project was to use Natural Language processing to better understand what different companies are looking to facilitate my job search.

### The How
* Used unsupervised learning models such as KMeans Clustering, LDA, NMF
* Created custom ngram tools to supplement those available in gensim
* Used TF-IDF Word Embedder to match job descriptions based on cosine similarity
* Visualized results using matplotlib / seaborn / plotly
* Created a prototype of the application using JavaScript / Flask
