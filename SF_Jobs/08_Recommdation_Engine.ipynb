      "  Shape the vision and architecture of the system infrastructure that powers the next-generation of intelligent machines. • Implement mission-critical software in a reliable and sustainable manner. • Craft tools, processes and frameworks to redefine the software development in the rise of autonomous systems powered by artificial intelligence. • Collaborate with, learn from, and mentor a team of diverse roles, which include software engineers, roboticists and AI researchers.  We look for a track record of the following: • 3+ years of software infrastructure experience • Solid background in multiple programming languages, e.g. Python or C/C++ and willingness to pick up any new programming languages or frameworks. • Experience, designing, implementing, and running production services • Having built enough systems to recognize what are the pragmatic designs (not the most fancy ones) • Fearless about jumping around the stack (from improving driver to writing CUDA kernel to putting together React webapp) and working on aspects that have significant impact on product You might be a good fit if you: • Have worked at a startup before. Enjoy the fast-paced environment. • Know how to scale yourself as the company grows, via mentorship, delegation, increased role and responsibilities. • Are self-directed and enjoy figuring out what is the most important problem to work on. • Own problems end-to-end, and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done. • Are detail oriented, and like to get the system working but know when to cut corners versus get it exactly right. • Have a strong interest in AI & robotics.\n"
